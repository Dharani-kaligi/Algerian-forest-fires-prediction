# 🔥 Algerian Forest Fires Dataset – EDA, Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing of the Algerian Forest Fires dataset. The goal is to understand wildfire patterns and analyze the relationship between meteorological conditions and fire occurrences in two regions of Algeria.

## 📌 Overview
Dataset: Algerian Forest Fires (2012)
Instances: 244 (122 from Bejaia, 122 from Sidi Bel-Abbes)
Goal: Analyze forest fire trends, clean the dataset, engineer features, scale data, and explore patterns for future ML modeling.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Objective
To explore how weather and environmental factors influence forest fires and prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.


## 📂 Dataset Information

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Date | From June to September 2012 |
| Temperature | Max temp at noon (°C) |
| RH | Relative Humidity (%) |
| Ws | Wind speed (km/h) |
| Rain | Daily rainfall (mm) |
| FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI | Fire Weather Index components |
| Classes | Fire / Not Fire (target variable) |

- 🔢 11 input features + 1 output (`Classes`)
- 🗺️ Two regions: Bejaia (0) and Sidi Bel-Abbes (1)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Removed null values
- Fixed column names and whitespace
- Removed unneeded rows (like row 122)
- Created a new column `Region` based on index
- Converted string/object columns to numerical types
- Encoded target classes (`Fire` → 1, `not fire` → 0)

## ⚖️ Feature Scaling

- Applied scaling to numerical features to normalize the range for model compatibility.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔍 Techniques Used:
Histograms & Density Plots: Visualize feature distributions and detect skewness.

Boxplots: Identify outliers in numerical features.

Correlation Matrix & Heatmap: Explore relationships between variables.

Pie Chart: Understand the distribution of target classes (Fire vs Not Fire).

Monthly Fire Trend Plot: Analyze fire occurrence patterns over different months.

## 🔥 Key Insights:
FWI, FFMC, and ISI show strong correlation with fire occurrences.

August had the highest number of fire cases in both regions.

The dataset is slightly imbalanced with approximately:

🔥 56% Fire

❌ 44% Not Fire

🧠 Model Training
✅ Models Used:
 Regression

Ridge Regression (RidgeCV)

Lasso Regression (LassoCV)

⚙️ Preprocessing:
Applied StandardScaler to normalize features.

Training performed on X_train_scaled.

📏 Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

AUC-ROC Curve

🔁 Cross-Validation
📌 Purpose:
To enhance generalization and avoid overfitting by validating model performance across multiple data splits.

🔄 Techniques Applied:
✅ 1. K-Fold Cross-Validation
Splits data into k equal folds.

Trains on k-1 folds, tests on the remaining fold.

Repeats k times and averages the results.

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=5)
print("Cross-validation scores:", scores)
✅ 2. RidgeCV & LassoCV
Automatically selects the best regularization strength (alpha) using internal CV.

Used for better bias-variance tradeoff in regularized regression.

from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV

alphas = [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]
ridge_model = RidgeCV(alphas=alphas, cv=5)
ridge_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
print("Best alpha:", ridge_model.alpha_)
⚠️ Why Cross-Validation?
📌 Avoids performance overestimation from a single train-test split.

📌 Ensures robust model performance across different data segments.

📌 Helps select optimal hyperparameters.
